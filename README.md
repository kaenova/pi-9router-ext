# pi-9router-ext

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/pi-9router-ext?color=blue)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pi-9router-ext)

Pi Coding Agent extension for [9router](https://github.com/decolua/9router) — an open-source AI routing proxy.

**Install:** `pi install npm:pi-9router-ext`

Connects Pi to your 9router instance via its OpenAI-compatible API, with dynamic model discovery and interactive configuration.

## Features

- **Auto-discovery** — Fetches available models and combos from 9router on startup
- **Dynamic provider** — Registers 9router as a Pi provider with live model list
- **Model metadata fallback** — Uses live router metadata when present, then cached models.dev metadata for context windows, output limits, and modalities
- **Graceful startup** — Loads commands/tools immediately and discovers 9router models in the background so Pi remains usable before API keys or routes are configured
- **Pi-native streaming** — Uses Pi's built-in OpenAI completions provider without overriding other providers
- **Status commands** — `/9router-status`, `/9router-models`, `/9router-config`, `/9router-reasoning`, `/9router-reload`
- **Manual reasoning toggle** — Optionally expose Pi thinking levels and send `reasoning_effort` to 9router
- **Web tools** — Exposes 9router web search/fetch routes as LLM-callable Pi tools
- **User-wide persistence** — Configuration survives new Pi instances via `~/.pi/agent/9router-config.json`
- **Routing detection** — Captures upstream model info from response headers when available

## Installation

### npm (Recommended)

```bash
pi install npm:pi-9router-ext
```

### Via local path

```bash
# Clone or download this repo
git clone https://github.com/irfansofyana/pi-9router-ext.git

# Install locally
pi install /path/to/pi-9router-ext

# Or try without installing
pi -e /path/to/pi-9router-ext
```

### Manual / development install

Prefer installing the package directory instead of copying individual source files. The extension may include multiple files, tools, commands, and helper modules; installing the directory lets Pi read the package manifest and load everything declared there.

```bash
# Clone or update the repo
git clone https://github.com/irfansofyana/pi-9router-ext.git
cd pi-9router-ext

# Install this working tree into Pi
pi install "$PWD"

# Reload Pi, then use /9router-config
```

Avoid copying only `src/index.ts` into `~/.pi/agent/extensions`. That bypasses `package.json` metadata and can miss companion files added by future features.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `NINE_ROUTER_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:20128` | Your 9router instance URL |
| `NINE_ROUTER_API_KEY` | — | API key if 9router has `REQUIRE_API_KEY=true` |
| `NINE_ROUTER_ENABLE_REASONING` | `false` | Set to `true`/`1`/`on` to expose Pi thinking levels for 9router models |

Set them in your shell profile or prefix your `pi` command:

```bash
NINE_ROUTER_BASE_URL=http://my-vps:20128 NINE_ROUTER_API_KEY=nr-... pi
```

### Interactive Configuration

Use the `/9router-config` command inside Pi to open a configuration menu for connection settings, reasoning, web defaults, web tools, and status/routes. This is saved to `~/.pi/agent/9router-config.json` and is shared by new Pi instances. Environment variables still take precedence when set.

```
/9router-config
```

Use `/9router-reasoning` to quickly enable or disable reasoning without changing the base URL or API key.

Web search/fetch defaults are configured from discovered `GET /v1/models/web` routes inside `/9router-config`. Direct provider routes such as `brave/search` and `tavily/fetch` are supported, as are 9router web combos.

### Model Limits and Metadata

9router-compatible `/v1/models` responses may only include `id`, `object`, and `owned_by`. When context/output limits are absent, the extension fills them from cached models.dev metadata at `~/.cache/pi/9router-model-metadata.json` (or `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/pi/9router-model-metadata.json`). Router-provided fields still take priority when available. If neither source has metadata, safe defaults are used: `128000` context tokens and a conservative `4096` output tokens.

## Usage

### Selecting a 9router Model

After the extension loads, 9router models are available in Pi's model picker under the dedicated `9router/` provider namespace:

```
/model 9router/cc/claude-opus-4-7
```

Built-in providers remain separate. To use Ollama Cloud, OpenRouter, opencode-go, etc., select their normal provider/model entries (for example `ollama-cloud/...`), not a `9router/...` model.

Or browse interactively:

```
/9router-models
```

### Reasoning / Thinking Levels

9router's `/v1/models` endpoint does not currently expose reliable per-model reasoning capability metadata. For safety, this extension keeps reasoning disabled by default.

If your selected 9router route/model supports reasoning, enable the manual toggle:

```
/9router-reasoning
```

When enabled, Pi treats 9router models as reasoning-capable. Use Pi's normal thinking controls such as Shift+Tab, `--thinking high`, or model suffixes like `9router/cx/gpt-5.3-codex:high`. Pi sends OpenAI-style `reasoning_effort` values to 9router (`off → none`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`).

### Web Search / Fetch Tools

If 9router exposes web routes from `GET /v1/models/web`, this extension lets the LLM call them through Pi tools:

- `ninerouter_web_search` — calls `POST /v1/search`
- `ninerouter_web_fetch` — calls `POST /v1/web/fetch`

Tools are registered by default. Use `/9router-config` → `Web tools` to hide or re-enable them; when disabled, they are removed from the model's active tool set. If no matching web route is configured or discovered, they fail with an actionable message telling you to configure web defaults in `/9router-config`.

Search supports all generic fields exposed by 9router:

```json
{
  "query": "latest pi coding agent extension docs",
  "route": "brave/search",
  "max_results": 5,
  "search_type": "web",
  "country": "US",
  "language": "en",
  "time_range": "week",
  "offset": 0,
  "domain_filter": ["github.com"],
  "content_options": {},
  "provider_options": {}
}
```

Fetch supports:

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "route": "tavily/fetch",
  "format": "markdown",
  "max_characters": 12000
}
```

`route` is optional. If omitted, the configured default route is used; if that route disappears, the extension falls back to the first discovered compatible route and records that in tool details/status. Per-call route overrides can be direct routes (`brave/search`, `tavily/fetch`) or combo names.

### Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/9router-status` | Show connection status, model count, web route count, and config |
| `/9router-models` | Browse and select from available 9router models |
| `/9router-config` | Menu for connection, reasoning, web defaults, web tools, and status/routes |
| `/9router-reasoning` | Enable or disable Pi thinking levels for 9router models |
| `/9router-reload` | Refresh model list and web routes from 9router |

### Available Tools

The LLM can call:

- `ninerouter_status` — check connection status, model list, and web route defaults
- `ninerouter_web_search` — search the web through 9router
- `ninerouter_web_fetch` — fetch/extract URL content through 9router

## How It Works

```
┌─────────┐     OpenAI-compatible      ┌──────────┐     ┌─────────────┐

     │
     │ 1. Fetches /v1/models and /v1/models/web on startup
     │ 2. Registers as provider "9router"
     │ 3. Uses pi-ai's normal OpenAI implementation for only 9router models
     │ 4. Registers web search/fetch as Pi tools
     │ 5. Leaves built-in/non-9router model switching untouched
```

## Troubleshooting

**"9router not configured" or no 9router models after install**
- This is expected before 9router is reachable or before an API key is configured.
- Pi remains usable; the extension discovers models in the background and registers the `9router` provider only after discovery succeeds.
- Run `/9router-config` to set connection details, then `/9router-reload`.

**"Failed to discover models from 9router"**
- Check that 9router is running: `curl http://localhost:20128/v1/models`
- Verify `NINE_ROUTER_BASE_URL` points to the correct host/port
- If `REQUIRE_API_KEY=true`, set `NINE_ROUTER_API_KEY`

**"No 9router models discovered"**
- 9router may have no active providers. Open the dashboard and connect a provider.
- Use `/9router-reload` to retry discovery.

**"No 9router web search/fetch route is configured or discovered"**
- Open the 9router dashboard and connect a web provider such as Brave, Tavily, Exa, or a web combo.
- Run `/9router-reload` or open `/9router-config` → `Web defaults` to refresh `/v1/models/web`.
- Pick separate default routes for search and fetch if more than one route exists.

**Models not showing in `/model` selector**
- Ensure the extension loaded: check for "9router connected" notification on startup
- Run `/9router-reload` to retry discovery
- Run `/reload` to refresh extensions

**Built-in provider returns 401 after installing this extension**
- Make sure the active model is the built-in provider (`ollama-cloud/...`, `openrouter/...`, etc.), not a `9router/...` route.
- Re-run `/login` for the built-in provider if its subscription token expired.
- This extension only registers provider id `9router`; it does not override built-in providers. If 9router is unreachable, the extension unregisters the `9router` provider instead of leaving an empty/broken provider around.
